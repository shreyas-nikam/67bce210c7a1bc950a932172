# Technical Specifications for Sources Capital Lab

## 1. Application Purpose
The **Sources Capital Lab** application is an interactive platform specifically designed to illustrate key financial analysis concepts and investment principles. Its primary goal is to allow users to engage with different financial metrics, visualizations, and decision-making tools that are relevant to capital management, thereby enhancing their understanding and application of investment strategies, risk management practices, and portfolio optimization techniques.

## 2. Data Requirements

### Data Sources
- **User Uploads**: Users will be able to upload CSV files consisting of financial data such as stock prices, revenue reports, or other quantitative metrics.
- **Pre-set Scenarios**: The application will feature a repository of predefined financial scenarios stored in a local database or accessible via APIs.

### Data Formats
- **CSV**: For user-uploaded files, adhering to a structured format (e.g., headers for date, stock symbol, price, volume).
- **JSON**: For predefined scenarios, particularly when fetched from web APIs.

### Preprocessing Steps
